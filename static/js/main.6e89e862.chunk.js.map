I’m a current teenager that attends Homestead high school in the Bay Area. Besides naturopathy my main interests include dance, taekwondo and being able to hangout with my friends. I got interested in the study of naturopathy when I saw many of my peers were struggling from problems such as mental breakdowns and immense amounts of stress from school and outside activities. Throughout my life I always had dance to take my mind off certain things and it acted as a stress reliever, but I quickly figured out that many teenagers and adults don't have this. I realized that if more people knew about things such as mental health and natural ways to take care of ourselves we can build a healthier lifestyle. I hope with exploring the study of naturopathy more people can learn these simple techniques of self care. Together let's embark on a journey to achieve beneficial behaviors that can improve our life. \n                                </p>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                    <div style={{display:'flex', flexDirection:'row', justifyContent:'space-around', marginTop:'2%', marginBottom:'2%'}}>\n                        <div className=\"card\" style={{width:\"25rem\"}}>\n                            <div className=\"card-body\">\n                                <h2 className='card-title'>\n                                    Contact Us\n                                </h2>\n                                <p className=\"card-text\">\n                                    Email: contact.naturomind@gmail.com\n                                </p>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        )\n    }\n}","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/how-it-helps-2.1682ed8a.png\";","import React from 'react';\nimport './HowItHelps.css';\nimport how_it_helps_2 from './how-it-helps-2.png';\n\nexport default class HowItHelps extends React.Component{\n    render() {\n        return (\n            <div className={'how-it-helps-wrapper-div'}>\n                <div className={'how-it-helps-title'}>\n                    Prevention is Better than Cure - A Holistic Approach to Health\n                </div>\n                <div className={'container'}>\n                    <img src={how_it_helps_2} className=\"card-img-top\" alt=\"...\"/>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        );\n    }\n}","import React from 'react';\nimport './Blog.css';\n\nexport default class Blog extends React.Component{\n    render() {\n        const urlInfo = window.location.href.split('/#/');\n        const pageNumber = urlInfo[1].split('/')[1];\n        console.log('pageNumber: ' + pageNumber);\n        return (\n            <div className={'blog-wrapper-div'}>\n                <h1>{`Article #1`}</h1>\n                <div style={{display:'flex', flexDirection:'row', justifyContent:'space-around', flex:1}}>\n                    <div style={{backgroundColor:'#ffffff', borderRadius:5, margin:5, flex:1}}>\n                        {`Article #1 Written Content Here (Coming Soon!)`}\n                    </div>\n                    <div style={{backgroundColor:'#ffffff', borderRadius:5, margin:5, flex:1}}>\n                        {`Article #1 Photos Here (Coming Soon!)`}\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                <nav aria-label=\"Page navigation example\" style={{marginTop:10}}>\n                    <ul className=\"pagination justify-content-center\">\n                        <li className={pageNumber === '1' ?

Diabetes occurs when your body cannot make or effectively use its own insulin, a hormone made by special cells in the pancreas called islets (eye-lets). Insulin serves as a “key” to open your cells, to allow the sugar (glucose) from the food you eat to enter. Then, your body uses that glucose for energy.\n                    <p>Main types of diabetics:</p>\n                    <ol>\n                        <li className={'diabetes-heart-health-bullet'}><p><b>Type 1 diabetes:</b> Type 1 diabetes, previously known as juvenile diabetes, is the most severe form of the disease. Type 1 diabetes has also been called juvenile diabetes because it usually develops in children and teenagers. But people of all ages can develop type 1 diabetes.</p>\n<p>In type 1 diabetes, the body’s immune system attacks the insulin-producing islet cells in the pancreas. The islet cells sense glucose in the blood and produce the right amount of insulin to normalize blood sugars. This attack on the body's own cells is known as autoimmune disease. Scientists are not sure why the autoimmune attack happens.</p>\n<p>But once the insulin-producing cells are destroyed, a person can no longer produce their own insulin. Without insulin, there is no “key.” So, the sugar stays in the blood and builds up. As a result, the body’s cells starve. And, if left untreated, high blood sugar levels can damage eyes, kidneys, nerves, and the heart, and can also lead to coma and death.</p>\nSo type 1 diabetes must be treated through a daily regimen of insulin therapy.\n                            <div className={'diabetes-heart-health-sub-subtitle-inner'}>\n                                What are the Warning Signs of Type 1 Diabetes?\n                            </div>\n                            <div className={'diabetes-heart-health-paragraph-inner'}>\n                                The onset of type 1 diabetes happens very quickly.

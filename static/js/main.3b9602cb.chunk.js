I\u2019m a current teenager that attends Homestead high school in the Bay Area. Besides naturopathy my main interests include dance, taekwondo and being able to hangout with my friends. I got interested in the study of naturopathy when I saw many of my peers were struggling from problems such as mental breakdowns and immense amounts of stress from school and outside activities. Throughout my life I always had dance to take my mind off certain things and it acted as a stress reliever, but I quickly figured out that many teenagers and adults don't have this. I realized that if more people knew about things such as mental health and natural ways to take care of ourselves we can build a healthier lifestyle.
